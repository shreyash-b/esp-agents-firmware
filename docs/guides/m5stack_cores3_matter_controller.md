## Configuring the Device

This is required to connect the device to your home's Wi-Fi network, which is necessary for the device to function.

- Once you have installed and launched the app, the app will ask for Bluetooth/Location permissions. This is required for the app to detect the unconfigured device's advertisement data.
- Sign in with your ESP RainMaker credentials, or create a new account if you don't have one.
- Power-on the device. It will show a QR Code (For devices with no display, the QR Code will be part of the product packaging)

You can factory reset your device using either of the following methods:

- Go to device settings in ESP RainMaker Home app -> Factory Reset

## Changing the Agent on the Device

To change the agent on the device, you will need the "ESP RainMaker Home" app. Download and install the app from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android):

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 12px;">
  <a href="https://apps.apple.com/in/app/esp-rainmaker-home/id1563728960">
    <img src="https://developer.apple.com/assets/elements/badges/download-on-the-app-store.svg" width="160">
  </a>
  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.espressif.novahome">
    <img src="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png" width="200">
  </a>
</div>


> Note: The User credentials for ESP RainMaker Home app will be the same as the ESP RainMaker app.
> If you are using this app for the first time, your devices will automatically be added to the "Home" group.
> If you had previously used this app, your devices will be added to the "Home" group by default.


When you create a new agent, in the Agents Dashboard you can click on Share Agent and generate the QR Code.

<img src="https://github.com/espressif/esp_agents_firmware/wiki/images/ShareAgent.png" width="200" style="display:block">

Now scan the QR Code from your phone's camera app / Google lens. The app will then launch the ESP RainMaker Home app.

The app will ask you to select the device that needs to be configured with this agent, and then it will go ahead and configure that device.
